= Why am I taking Systems-Programming?
I'm taking Systems-Programming because I'm primarily interested in the low-ish level details of how
computers operate. I spend my free time learning about low-level programing and concepts, and would
like to formalize that knowledge.

= What do I hope to learn from Systems-Programming?
My main goal in Systems-Programming is to better learn C and how the systems in a computer interact.
I've written C before and have a decent understanding of the language/concepts, but I've never done
anything serious or at a system level before.
